Playlists
=========

A list of videos, similar to the same concept in YouTube. This provides an n:m mapping, meaning that every playlist can
contain multiple videos, and each video can be included in multiple playlists. (As opposed to the 1:n mapping of
Opencast series, where each video is part of at most one series.)

Playlists are currently only available through their rest endpoint and don't show up anywhere else.
